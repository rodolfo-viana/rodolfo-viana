Hi,

My name is Rodolfo Viana. I am a data engineer and AI lecturer based in Brazil.

I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at Unesp, where my research focuses on brain tumor segmentation algorithms.

Here you will find a selection of my work, studies, personal stuff and collaborations on open-source projects.

Enjoy your reading.
